# RBE Matrix theme

This theme is a basic bright green "Matrix"-like theme. However, this design incorporates some reds and blues to make
the syntax easier to digest at a  glance. I am mainly a Ruby on Rails developer, so I have tested this theme thoroughly
on ruby, html, haml, markdown, asciidoc, javascript, SQL, coffeescript, ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and JSON. I have included some
test files in the source code of this syntax plugin, as a test. These were taken from the [highlight.js](http://hightlightjs.org) web site. 

# Base Theme
This theme can be used as a base theme for your next theme, and has been hand-crafted with every available option. You are free to use this theme as a base for your own. For info about all options, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference.
